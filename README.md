## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Although this is a project that mainly we can develop in HTML and CSS, I developed it in React using two components (Request.jsx and Thank.you.jsx) and CSS for the styles. A lot of learning left this exercise:

- Conditional rendering to switch both components.
- Two state variables to manage the rating and a boolean variable to manage if the user rated or not.
- Active pseudo class in CSS to show as "selected" the rating.
- Props and onclick event to develop the functionality of this challenge.
- Media queries CSS to switch between mobile and desktop versions.

### Continued development

I would like to continue developing this challenges using React as main resource and complementing with other ones as HTML5, CSS, SAAS, among others
